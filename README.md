# Matrix Operations
Create a function called generate_random_matrix that takes two arguments: rows and cols. This function should generate a 2D matrix of random integers between 1 and 100, with rows rows and cols columns. Use the random module from the Python standard library to generate random numbers. The matrix should be returned as a list of lists.

Create a function called get_column_sum that takes two arguments: a matrix (2D list) and a column index. This function should calculate and return the sum of all the values in the specified column of the matrix.

Create a function called get_row_average that takes two arguments: a matrix (2D list) and a row index. This function should calculate and return the average (mean) of all the values in the specified row of the matrix.
